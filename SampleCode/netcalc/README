Overview of files and sub-directories for the netcalc examples
==============================================================

1. Files shared by the client and server
    Makefile                : make file for all the netcalc examples 
    netcalc.h               : general header file
    netcalc_util_soc.c      : common utility functions for socket only

2. Server files
    netcalc_app_srv.c       : application layer of the server
    netcalc_srv_main.c      : main function for server (ver 2, 3, 4, and 5)
    netcalc_srv.c           : version 1 of the server (main included)
    netcalc_srv_v2.c        : version 2 of the server (main not included)
    netcalc_srv_v3.c        : version 3 of the server (main not included)
    netcalc_srv_v4.c        : version 4 of the server (main not included)
    netcalc_srv_v5.c        : version 5 of the server (main not included)
    netcalc_srv_v6.c        : version 6 of the server (main included)

3. Client files
    netcalc_app_clnt.c      : application layer of the client (needs to 
                              implement the user interface)
    netcalc_clnt_main.c     : main function for client (ver 2, 3, and 4)
    netcalc_clnt.c          : version 1 of the client (main included)
    netcalc_clnt_v2.c       : version 2 of the client (main not included)
    netcalc_clnt_v3.c       : version 3 of the client (main not included)
    netcalc_clnt_v4.c       : version 4 of the client (main not included)
    netcalc_clnt_udp.c      : udp version of the client (main included)

4. Testers
    netcalc_test.c          : special client for testing
    netcalc_test_file_1.txt : test file 1 for input re-direction
    netcalc_test_file_2.txt : test file 2 for input re-direction

5. Sub-directories
    var0                    : original example (text book wrappers)
    var1                    : variation 1 of the example (err_ wrappers)
    var2                    : variation 2 of the example (no wrappers)

                              address conversion, sock info, and 
                              application record
    version 3               : version 2 + fork child server + signal
    version 4               : version 2 + io multiplexing (a bug in it as
                              it will fail test case 2)
    version 5               : version 2 + thread for each client
