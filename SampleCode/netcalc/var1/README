Overview of files for the myerror lib version of the  netcalc example
=====================================================================

This is variation 1 of the version 1 of the netcalc example.  It does not use
the wrapper functions contained in the library from the text book (libunp.a).  
It does use, however, the err_xxx functions which originates from the APUE 
book and is easily available with the myerror.h and myerror.c file.
